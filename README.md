# react-coding-challenge-counter-frontend

Create a simple webapp for a counter that displays the same amount of stars under it

(You can use any image you want)

The count should increase when the add 1 button is clicked.

The count should decrease when the remove 1 button is clicked.

Prevent the count from below 0 (zero).

Upload your app to a GitHub repo and submit the repo link.
